# Name of the Project

LEROY MERLIN SALESPERSON TRAINING.

## Pitch of the project

The continuous arrival of new products on the market at Leroy Merlin creates challenges for sales staff regarding product knowledge. Moreover, training a new employee takes time, espe- cially observation time, which is not profitable for the company. The current training method used by Leroy Merlin is time-consuming, costly, and not optimal for its employees.

Our solution is to create 3D environments compatible with VR to enable a new learning expe- rience for Leroy Merlin's sales staff. They will be able to learn about various products from dif- ferent brands in one place and be assessed on their knowledge, all in an engaging and inter- active way. The different environments would consist of sets designed in accordance with each brand's existing visual language, with in-store products integrated. Creating software makes it very easy to update the product range. Employees can observe, dismantle, repair, and assemble objects. They can learn about their specific features and see them in action on virtual terrain, allowing them to effectively understand the product, its use, and its functionalities in record time. Leroy Merlin also owns 15 brands available and promoted in-store, as these brands are local, making internal communication easy and straightforward. For these 15 brands, the knowl- edge to be acquired will be strengthened, particularly to help sales staff promote all the brand's values, such as eco-design, local manufacturing, and more.
So, our concept allows companies and employees to save time, money, and, above all, improve well-being and reduce mental stress.
